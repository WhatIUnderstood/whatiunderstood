### Deep learning follow up

First lets recap the main deep learning categories:
- [Supervised Learning](https://www.guru99.com/supervised-machine-learning.html): This network is supervised, this means that you need someone telling the network what it should outputs with a lot of examples. It won't adapt to situations that it has never seen. You need to stay close to what it knowns. This is the most common deep learning you may encounter if you are not a researcher. This network targets classification and regression problems.
- [Unsupervised Learning](https://www.guru99.com/unsupervised-machine-learning.html): This approach is a better, you give a lot of example to this network without telling him what it should output. It will try to group examples that are close together (according to him ^^) and create a class for it. It is funny because humans have to find afterward why the network made these classes. This network is used for clustering and associations problems.
- [Reinforcement learning](https://deepsense.ai/what-is-reinforcement-learning-the-complete-guide/): Here we are training a network to make decisions sequencially. It use trial and error to find the best solution. It is often use for games (chess, startcraft2). Here the human interaction is to define a score for any situation in the environment. Then you let the network playing a lot trying to improve its final score.
