## What I understood during my quest to build a strong artificial intelligence

### Building a biomimetic brain
My goal here is to **build a real time biomimetic brain**. That means that I will try to virtually replicate a real human brain. I hope to create an intelligence while doing it.

Why realtime? I want it to learn something before I die ^^.

Being realtime will force me to do some compromises that I hope won't prevent intelligence to exists. I will explain all compromises I will do and why. If you disagree on one point fell free to tell me and try your one way!

Lets get a plan on how to proceed.

**Step 1 The senses:** Consider the brain as a black box: don't consider yet how the brain is working. Just analyze what are its **inputs and outputs**.
A better understanding of the nature of its input is compulsory to do biomimetism.

**Step 2 Senses modelisation:** Build libraries to generate these inputs and outputs.

**Step 3 The brain:** Dive on how the brain works. How it links all theses inputs and outputs (neurons, cortical areas, hormones, ...)

**Step 4 Brain modelisation:** Implement a brain making some compromises to keep it realtime

**Step 5 Brain expériments:** Send inputs to the brain and try to detect signs of intelligence. If I can't detect it:
 - try to find macroscopic differences with a real human brain => go back to step 3 to find why it is not happening in human brain.
  - look over all compromises

**Step 6 Are you sure?**

I already went to step 5 and I want to present what I understood on the way. I hope you will learn something ^^

## Step 1: The Senses

I will cover the following senses
  - [The retina](sensors/retina/retina.html) (redaction ongoing)
  - ears (redaction todo)
  - touch (redaction todo)
  - musles (redaction todo)

</a>

## Step 2: Senses modelisation
(I am cleaning the code ^^)

## Step 3: The brain
  - neurons (redaction on going)
  - cortical areas (redaction on going)
  - hormones (redaction on going)
  - What we can currently see in the brains? (irmf, public databases) (redaction on going)
  - experimentations
  - ...

## Step 4: Brain modelisation
(redaction on going)

## Step 5: Brain expériments
(redaction on going)
