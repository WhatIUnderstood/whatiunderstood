# Quest to build a strong artificial intelligence

My goal here is to **build a real time biomimetic brain**. That means that I will try to virtually replicate a real human brain. I hope to create an intelligence while doing it.

Why realtime? I want it to learn something before I die ^^.

Being realtime will force me to do some compromises that I hope won't prevent intelligence to exists. I will explain all compromises I will do and why. If you disagree on one point fell free to tell me and try your one way!

Lets get a plan on how to proceed.

Plan

- [Quest to build a strong artificial intelligence](#quest-to-build-a-strong-artificial-intelligence)
  - [Step 1 The senses](#step-1-the-senses)
  - [Step 2 Senses modelisation](#step-2-senses-modelisation)
  - [Step 3 The brain](#step-3-the-brain)
  - [Step 4 Brain modelisation](#step-4-brain-modelisation)
  - [Step 5 Brain expériments](#step-5-brain-exp%c3%a9riments)
  - [Step 6 Are you sure?](#step-6-are-you-sure)

-----------------------------
## Step 1 The senses

Consider the brain as a black box: don't consider yet how the brain is working. Just analyze what are its **inputs and outputs**.
A better understanding of the nature of its input is compulsory to do biomimetism.

- [The retina](sensors/retina/retina.html) (redaction ongoing)
- Ears (redaction todo)
- touch (redaction todo)
- musles (redaction todo)

</a>

-----------------------------
## Step 2 Senses modelisation

Build libraries to generate these inputs and outputs.
- [retina modelisation](sensors/retina/retina_modelisation.html) (redaction ongoing)
- Ears (redaction todo)
- touch (redaction todo)
- musles (redaction todo)

-----------------------------
## Step 3 The brain

Dive on how the brain works. How it links all theses inputs and outputs (neurons, cortical areas, hormones, ...)

-----------------------------
## Step 4 Brain modelisation

Implement a brain making some compromises to keep it realtime.
  - neurons (redaction on going)
  - cortical areas (redaction on going)
  - hormones (redaction on going)
  - What we can currently see in the brains? (irmf, public databases) (redaction on going)
  - experimentations
  - ...

(redaction on going)

-----------------------------
## Step 5 Brain expériments
Send inputs to the brain and try to detect signs of intelligence. If I can't detect it:
 - try to find macroscopic differences with a real human brain => go back to step 3 to find why it is not happening in human brain.
  - look over all compromises

(redaction on going)

-----------------------------
## Step 6 Are you sure?
I already went to step 5 and I want to present what I understood on the way. I hope you will learn something ^^
