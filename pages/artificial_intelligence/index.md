## What I understood during my quest to build a strong artificial intelligence

First I want to explain the context when I started this quest. In 2013, I was working in an innovation team working in the computer vision field, a collegue presented me the book "On Intelligence (2004)" from Jeff Hawkins. He presents a functional theory on how the humain brain works. He based his theory from human behaviours, brain observations and how brains deseases/damages impacted the human behaviour. An interresting part is when he presents the brain as a prediction machine that learns when it's prediction is not verified. Even if it is an old book I recommand it. Jeff Hawkins also wanted to build a strong artificial intelligence from his theory. He created the project [nupic](https://github.com/numenta/nupic) _Numenta Platform for Intelligent Computing is an implementation of Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM), a theory of intelligence based strictly on the neuroscience of the neocortex_. However the project implemented a really tiny part of the book with to many simplifications that won't allow strong artificial intelligence.

After deciding to start my own implementation of a strong artificial intelligence the deep-learning keyword just showed up everywhere. Everyone was talking about this new kind of artificial intelligence learning by itself. My first encounter was with [cuda-convnet](https://code.google.com/archive/p/cuda-convnet/) (2013). However I was quickly disapointed when I understood how it works and how far it was from a strong intelligence. So I decided to continue on my path to build my own neuronal network.

Let's talk about my approach now. I wanted to build a nearly real time biomimetic brain. That means that I try to copy the real human brain with some compromises to be able to interact with it in live. I will always explain my compromises, and each time I do one it should not prevent the network from being intelligent (according to what I think ^^). You may have noticed that this approach is trying to create intelligence by copy without understanding everything. I hope getting a lot of hints on strong intelligence on the path and I want to share this here.

To start my biomimetic approach I looked the inputs and outputs of the brain (retina, ears, touch, musles) and what exactly was going into/outside the brain.
Then I looked how the brain link all theses inputs and outputs (neurons, cortical areas, hormones, ...). At each point I will also publish my implementation.

- The brain outputs/inputs
  - The retina (redaction on going)
  - ears (redaction on going)
  - musles (redaction on going)
- The brain
  - neurons (redaction on going)
  - cortical areas (redaction on going)
  - hormones (redaction on going)
  - What we can currently see in the brains? (irmf, public databases) (redaction on going)
  - ...
- Annexes
  - [deep learning follow up](deep_learning.md) (redaction on going)
